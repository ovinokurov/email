## Overview

This application is a Python-based tool that enables users, particularly job seekers, to filter and sort through their email inboxes effectively. Recognizing the sheer volume of emails received on a daily basis, this tool is designed to help you easily identify and retrieve crucial job opportunity emails, utilizing a keyword-based search in both the subject and body of your emails.

With this application, you can generate a report showing the sender, subject, and date of the emails containing these key job-related terms. This saves you the time and effort of manually sifting through each email, making your job search more efficient and targeted.

## Usage

1. **Set Up Your Credentials**: Before running the script, replace the placeholders `"YOUR_USERNAME@hotmail.com"` and `"YOUR_PASSWORD"` in the Python script with your actual Hotmail username and password.

2. **Select Date Range**: Upon running the application, you will be prompted to select a date range for the emails to be searched. The options include:
    - Today
    - Yesterday
    - Last 7 days
    - Last month

3. **Run the Application**: After selecting the desired date range, the application will fetch all emails within this range, search for the specified keywords, and generate a report with details of relevant emails.

The aim is to streamline your job search process by delivering pertinent emails directly to you, ensuring no potential job opportunity is missed amidst the daily influx of emails.
